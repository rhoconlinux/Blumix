Blumix Gtk3.10 
======

**Blumix Gtk Theme: Simple. Rounded. Essential.** Started as a minimal Blue-ish Mod for Numix Gtk3 Theme, now, with some perspective, it's growing with its own identity. It supports gtk3.10, gtk3.6, gtk2and metacity3. :)

Install it:
-----------


## Ninja Install (yeah): 
just copy-paste this line in your terminal. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Magic will happen. 
*(It will ask for super-user permissions to copy the theme in /usr/share/themes)*

```
mkdir -p ~/blumix-install && cd ~/blumix-install && wget https://github.com/rhoconlinux/Blumix/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip && cd Blumix-master && sudo rm -Rf --force /usr/share/themes/Blumix1.0/ && sudo cp -a Blumix /usr/share/themes/Blumix1.0 && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Blumix1.0" &&  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme 'Blumix1.0' && cd ~ && rm -R ~/blumix-install/

```

| Note |
|--------|
|Please note that **this theme _will require_ murrine, pixbuf and unico engines installed** on your system. If you don't have them, Firefox, Thunderbird, Libreoffice and other gtk2 programs won't draw the theme (and you'll get a win95 look).To install the requiried packages in Ubuntu and derivatives, run: 
|`sudo apt-get install -y gtk2-engines-murrine gtk2-engines-pixbuf gtk3-engines-unico`

### Manual install:
Download the file from [here](https://github.com/rhoconlinux/Blumix/archive/master.zip) (or click on the "download" button on the right sidebar). Once you got the file, uncompress the zip. Browse the uncompressed content and copy the folder named **Blumix (not *blumix-master*!)** in */usr/share/themes/* (*this will require root access*). Apply it with your favourite tunning tool (gnome-tweaks, unity-tweak, ubuntu-tweak... etc.). If you can't see properly some apps read the note above... probably you should install the required engines to make it work. You can also pass by and give a like in deviant-art and gnome-look if you feel so. If you see anything odd, please report a bug or drop a comment in [my blog](https://rhoconlinux.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/blumix-1-0-actualizado-el-tema-gtk3-10-minimalismo-nuevo/).
